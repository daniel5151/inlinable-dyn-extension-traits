# Optional Trait Methods in Rust

An exploration into various ways optional trait methods can be implemented in Rust.

-   The `complete` folder contains a big-blob of example code which shows off the various techniques.
    -   It also includes various Assembly listings generated from godbolt.org, and a handy-dandy `godbolt.sh` script, which outputs the crate as a single file that can be copy/pasted into godbolt.org.
-   `writeup.md` contains the draft version of a writeup discussing the various techniques

The intention is to eventually split up that big blob of code into smaller, more manageable chunks which can be individually benchmarked + referenced from a writeup.
